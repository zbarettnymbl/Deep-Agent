# Deep-Agent

This repository hosts examples that explore deep agent patterns using LangChain
and LangGraph. The highlighted example demonstrates how a primary
`AgentExecutor` can delegate work to specialized sub-agents implemented as
LangGraph workflows.

## Examples

- [`examples/langgraph_basic/main.py`](examples/langgraph_basic/main.py) shows a
  minimal LangGraph workflow that relies on inline tools and a single agent
  nodeâ€”no `AgentExecutor` required.
- [`examples/deep_agent/main.py`](examples/deep_agent/main.py) expands on that
  foundation by introducing a coordinating `AgentExecutor` that can dispatch to
  multiple LangGraph sub-agents.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies and configure an OpenAI compatible API key as described
   in the [Deep Agent Example Guide](docs/deep_agent_example.md#prerequisites).
2. Review the annotated script at
   [`examples/deep_agent/main.py`](examples/deep_agent/main.py) to understand how
   language models, tools, and graphs are orchestrated.
3. Run the example with:

   ```bash
   python examples/deep_agent/main.py
   ```

   The script prints the coordinator's response after delegating to research and
   writing sub-agents.
